At night, when the city finally becomes quiet, the sky reveals its oldest story.
Stars appear one by one, not in a hurry, as if they have all the time in the universe.
Each point of light is a sun, distant beyond imagination, yet calmly visible to the human eye.

For thousands of years, people have looked upward and asked the same questions.
What is out there?
Where do we come from?
Why does the universe exist at all?

Modern science gave us extraordinary answers.
We learned that stars are born, grow old, and eventually disappear.
We discovered galaxies colliding, black holes bending space, and planets orbiting distant suns.
Still, the feeling of wonder never vanished.

Technology allows us to explore space with machines, but wonder is explored with the mind.
A telescope can show a galaxy, but curiosity gives it meaning.
The universe does not need us to understand it, yet it quietly invites us to try.

Perhaps that is the most wonderful thing of all.
In a vast and silent cosmos, a small thinking species learned how to ask questions.
And every question brings us a little closer to the stars.
