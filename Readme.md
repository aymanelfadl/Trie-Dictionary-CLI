# Trie Dictionary CLI

A simple command-line project that implements a **Trie (prefix tree)** to store and query words.

## Features

* Build a trie from a dictionary file
* Insert words
* Search exact words
* Suggest words by prefix
* Count words sharing a prefix

## Build & Run

```bash
make
./trie
```

## Commands

* `load <file>` – load words from a file
* `insert <word>` – insert a word
* `search <word>` – search a word
* `suggest <prefix> [n]` – autocomplete suggestions
* `count <prefix>` – count words with the prefix
* `help`, `quit`

## Notes

* Words are normalized (lowercase, letters only)
* Focuses on the trie structure, inspired by spell-checker logic
